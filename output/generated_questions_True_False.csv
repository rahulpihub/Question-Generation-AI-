Topic,Subtopic,Level,Question Type,Question,Answer
databricks,data engineers,Advanced,True/False,"Delta Live Tables (DLT) in Databricks automatically handle schema evolution and enforcement, eliminating the need for data engineers to manually manage schema changes in production pipelines.",True
databricks,data engineers,Advanced,True/False,"Databricks SQL allows data engineers to define and orchestrate complex data pipelines using only SQL, without requiring knowledge of Python or other programming languages. While helpful for many tasks, this completely eliminates the need for tools like Apache Spark for complex transformations.",False
databricks,data engineers,Advanced,True/False,"Data engineers using Databricks can leverage the built-in integration with MLflow to track and manage machine learning experiments, including model versioning, parameter logging, and artifact storage, even if they are not directly involved in model development.",True
databricks,data engineers,Advanced,True/False,"Databricks's auto-scaling capabilities dynamically adjust the compute resources based on workload demands, meaning data engineers never have to configure cluster sizes or worry about resource allocation for optimal performance.",False 
databricks,data engineers,Advanced,True/False,"Using Databricks Connect, data engineers can connect their preferred IDE (like IntelliJ or VS Code) directly to Databricks clusters, enabling local development and debugging of Spark code against a remote Databricks environment without impacting production workloads.",True
